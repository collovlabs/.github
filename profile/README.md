##  World Engine: Pioneering Spatial Design Intelligence on the Path to AGI

We believe a critical milestone on the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is building a model that can **perceive the world in its full complexity, understand the spatial structure behind it**, and **create visually stunning and functional designs** with the following capabilities:
- **Precision:** Millimetre-level accuracy in measurements.
- **Authenticity:** Generate real, purchasable items with realistic textures and structures.
- **Complexity:** Design intricate architecture while adhering to local regulations.
- **Interactivity:** Enable real-time editing and viewing with a 24Hz refresh rate for 1080p image generation, matching human visual perception.
### Spatial Design Intelligence
We define spatial design intelligence as the convergence of spatial perception, understanding, planning, and creation capabilities. This form of intelligence is fundamental to many human cognitive tasks, such as:
- Designing room layouts and architectural plans.
- Crafting immersive game environments.
- Creating detailed character models.
These tasks, while intuitive for humans, present significant challenges for current AI models. 
### Introducing World Engine
Our groundbreaking "World Engine" project aims to bridge this gap by mastering spatial design intelligence. By understanding, manipulating, and creating within 3D space, World Engine is a pivotal step towards AGI.
### Beyond Specific Domains
World Engine is more than just an AI tool for specific domains. It represents a fundamental advancement in AI's ability to interact with and understand the physical world, mirroring human cognition.
